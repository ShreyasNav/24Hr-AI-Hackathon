# 24Hr-AI-Hackathon
We have used Mistral AI for image analysis of tweet and covert to text
FinBERT to get sentiment scores from text and text converted from image of tweet
Then OHLCV data and sentiment scores are put as features to a Time Transformer model that predicts closing price
Could not get time to find predictions for all 40 coins, but the model is working so do consider it.
